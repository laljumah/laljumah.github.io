<h1>Painting</h1>

<p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium
  to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support"). The medium is commonly
  applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges,
  and airbrushes, can be used. The support for paintings includes such surfaces
  as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete,
  and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay,
  paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects. Paintings can be naturalistic
  and representational (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic,
  abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in
  Expressionism), and/or political in nature (as in Artivism).<br>
