<h1>Pottery</h1>

<p>Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects
  with clay and other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures
  to give them a hard, durable form. Major types include earthenware, stoneware
  and porcelain. Pottery is made by forming a ceramic (often clay) body into
  objects of a desired shape and heating them to high temperatures (600-1600 Â°C)
  in a bonfire, pit or kiln and induces reactions that lead to permanent changes
  including increasing the strength and rigidity of the object. Much pottery is
  purely utilitarian, but much can also be regarded as ceramic art. A clay body
  can be decorated before or after firing.<br>
